#### Introduction
```
- As part of Today's #Learn365, I checked out the latest Vulnerability Wiki Published by Cobalt.io's Pentest Architect, Busra D. (areyou1or0). 

- This Wiki is a unique database with vulnerability Proof of Concepts to act as a resource for pentesters. The findings are categorized by OWASP ASVS category.

- This Wiki has a nice collection of Proof of Concept and helps you to understand some interesting stuff along with some pre-defined impact scenarios which will allow you to rate your submissions in a better way.

- There are tons of vulnerabilities currently and I hope the list will updated in future as well being a goldmine to learn something new.
