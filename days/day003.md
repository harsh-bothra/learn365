# SAML Vulnerabilities
Security Assertion Markup Language) is widely used for authentication. \
It uses XML schema and is prone to multiple security vulnerabilities. \
Some of the common security issues are

#### Signature Wrapping (XSW) Attacks
```
XSW Attacks happen when the XML Digital Signature (XML DSig) is not validated which is used to establish a trust b/w IDPs & Service Providers.

This attack can lead to situations like Privilege Escalation, Authentication Abuse & Denial of Service as well.

There are multiple variants of XSW attacks from XSW1 to XSW8 (Way of exploitation varies a bit). You can read more about them here in little details

```

#### XML Attacks

```
Due to the improper input validation and DTD processing
The SAML implementation might be Vulnerable to XXE and XML DoS Attacks like Billian Laugh Attack.
```
#### SAML Message Integrity Abuse
```
Using the SAML Message from other users or forged SAML message to bypass the restriction or may lead to bypass the authentication
```
#### Missing / Invalid Signature
```
Missing or Invalid Signature may allow an attacker to forge a signature and abuse the implementation
```
#### SAML Message Replay
```
Assertion ID should be unique and one ID should be accepted only once.
```
### CSRF
```
Due to improper validation it is possible to carry out CSRF in SAML Implementation
```
#### XML Comment Handling
```
A threat actor who already has authenticated access into an SSO system can authenticate as another user without that individualâ€™s SSO password
```
#### XSLT
```
XSLT (eXtensible Stylesheet Transformation Language) Attack can also be leverage against SAML Implementation
```
#### Token Recipient Confusion
```
Attacker Token is used to login to Victim Account.
```
